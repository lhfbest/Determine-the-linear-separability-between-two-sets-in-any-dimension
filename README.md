# Determine-the-linear-separability-between-two-sets-in-any-dimension

**This code can be used to quickly determine the linear separability between two sets in any dimension. A GPU is required.**

**It is based on paper: "Shuiming Zhong and Huan Lyu, 'A New Sufficient & Necessary Condition for Testing Linear Separability between Two Sets', TPAMI 2024."
So, if used, remember to cite this reference.**

**This code is implemented solely to verify the feasibility of the algorithm presented in the paper. 
There are many aspects where efficiency can be further optimized. Your corrections and suggestions are most welcome!**

NOTES:
  - After downloading the folder, you can run the LS_Testing_Demo.m directly in the matlab environment. 
  - A GPU is required. If the matlab version is too low (the code is written under matlab2023), an error may be reported.
  - The Demo provides two operating modes. One is to generate two point sets A and B from the code to test their linear separability (for a quick try). The other is to import local data to determine linear separability. Dimension10_Size5000_LS.csv is the sample data. Detailed input data specifications can be found in the instructions in LS_Tesing.
